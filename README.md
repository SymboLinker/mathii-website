Many years ago, when I just started learning to program, I created this website. The code quality is therefore very bad.

I had in mind:
- no server calls should be needed (offline use is possible).
- works on smart boards, laptops, phones, etc.
- no database.
- no login required.
- free.
- no ads.
- just one touch should be needed for getting/checking the answer.
